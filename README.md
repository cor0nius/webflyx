# Webflyx - A Git Practice Repository

This repository was created as part of the ["Learn Git"](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git) course on boot.dev. The primary purpose of this project was not to build a functional application, but to serve as a hands-on environment for practicing fundamental Git commands and workflows.

## Key Git Skills Practiced

*   **Repository Initialization:** Setting up a new Git repository from scratch.
*   **Committing Changes:** Staging and committing files to track project history.
*   **Branching and Merging:** Creating new branches to work on features in isolation and merging them back into the main branch.
*   **Viewing History:** Inspecting the commit log to understand the project's evolution.
*   **Pushing to a Remote:** Pushing local changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
